Your DontAsk modification can make typing code a bit more pleasent and we are interested in adding it to each student's Newton.>Do you have an educational price on 20 licenses? I haven't been asked this before, so let's come up with a price. normally, I ask $5. but since it's multiple copies and you're an educational institution, does ~$40 for 20 licenses seem reasonable? thanks for inquiring.Stevep.s. if you'll be doing some coding on the Newton, maybe you'd be interested in the Newt Development Environment. DontAsk is free with that, though Newt is more expensive, I could also come up with a discount (Slurpee is also included which can also speed up text entry via keyboard & file xfer)... for more info about Newt etc., see http://www.netaxs.com/~weyer/newton/releases.html
