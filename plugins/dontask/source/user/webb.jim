However, I also upgraded my Newton 110 to 1.3(345333) from Apple. I am getting the message "Sorry, a problem has occurred. (-48410)" and my Newton will not shut off; I have to press reset in order to respond to the power switch. Are you aware of any incompatibility that might be causing this? If I can resolve this, I'll be registering... Thanks,Jim WebbI'm not aware of any problems. I just tried it on my MP110 which I also upgraded to 345333 and it works fine. keyboard comes up, toggle button ok, etc. are you sure that DontAsk is the culprit?? does it occur just when you open the kbd? other keyboard utilities installed?? (I know that DontAsk does NOT work with NOS 2.0; on the other hand, it's not needed).
