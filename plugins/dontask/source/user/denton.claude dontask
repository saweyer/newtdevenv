Since I hadn't added "DontAsk" officially with Kagi (Idon't recall if there's a $10 minimum or not; and frankly didn't expect as manyregistrations as I have gotten), I don't know if it will get thru or not. (ormaybe it will process as "Slurpee" for $5). If it does, we'll both receive aconfirmation from Kagi.in the meanwhile, I'll check with Kagi about what happens. (I could add an entryto the Mac & Windows versions, but not sure how to add a register button to theNewton app itself...)anyway thanks.Steve-----Date: Sun, 17 Sep 1995 19:35:50 -0700To: claude.denton@tek.com, claude.denton@email.HUB.TEK.COMFrom: kee@kagi.com (kee nethery)Subject: Thanks for your registrationCc: weyer@kagi.comShareware fee received:1 User License for DontAsk:TKnollSys, US 5.00Registered-To: Claude DentonEmail: claude.denton@tek.com,claude.denton@email.HUB.TEK.COMPayment-Method: FirstVirtualTotal Amount Paid: US 5.00Date: 1995-09-15Invoice: T179936016
