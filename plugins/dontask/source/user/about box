If i read your post correctly, I don't yet understand why you would want to do away with it. I'd like to see you enhance it by adding a momentary string display/dialog box that might announce its purpose. By the way, I will be sending the shareware fee ($45.00) for the NEWT package. I enjoy programming as a hobby and your product looks like a fun way to explore newtonScript. I've got a lot to learn. But, I believe that the Newton's potential is awesome and it will be worth the effort. I am glad that you are so active in the Newton Newsgroups. It makes me think that you will be available for support if I really get stuck. btw, i imagine that you are tremendously busy. So, no reply is needed for this message.
