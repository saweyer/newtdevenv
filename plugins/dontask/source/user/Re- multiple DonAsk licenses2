We need DontAsk for an introductory course where students will be writing and running small programs inside their Newton textbook. (See http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~schlimme/newton/index.shtml for details.) $40 for 20 copies sounds fine.>I would like to get a copy of Slurpee with its source code as part of a Newton programming course we teach. We have a lab with 7 Macs, NTKs, and a bunch of Newtons.>If you can, please write up an invoice listing the 20 copies of DontAsk and 1 copy with source of Slurpee, FAX it to me, and I'll get our purchasing department to process it.hi Jeff,for Slurpee, I'd be glad to include a copy of source (if version 1.5 would be ok, I could provide it in either .nwt or NTK format for free). If that's ok, here is an invoice below for 20 copies of DontAsk & 1 copy of Slurpee -- for a total of $50. (or I could fax something prettier if that's preferable). stevep.s. is WSU in Pullman? as a native Seattlite, I'm now living in a place with "Washington" in its name. --------To: Jeffrey C.
