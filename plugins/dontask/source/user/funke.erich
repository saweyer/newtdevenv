"DontAsk", which I think is great. Small 'n quick. A clever idea and one that might have saved me hours of potential frustration, had I known about it sooner. (I hate... no, let me rephrase that....I HATE THE NEWTON KEYBOARD PROMPT!!!!!!) I currently use the Newt 120 with OS1.3, but am soon going to be upgrading the hardware to OS2.0. Do you know if "DontAsk" will still work under the new OS? (Possibly a very stupid question, if I were a developer, and I know that you must be truly frustrated at having to deal with queries such as this one, but does it help if I tell you I live in a third-world country, and that I'm not expected to be as technologically advanced as you are? So there.......!)Next thing is, will it still cost 5 bucks (R20.00 over here - third world exchange rate.), if you have had to rewrite it for OS2.0...come to think of it, will I still need something like "DontAsk"? I'm sure you're a busy person (as many people out there love telling me), but if and when you have the time please could you reply to my mail and let me know?Thankyou, Erich.
