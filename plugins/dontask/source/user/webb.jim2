I just tried it on my MP110 which I also upgraded to 345333 and it works fine. keyboard comes up, toggle button ok, etc.are you sure that DontAsk is the culprit?? does it occur just when you open the kbd? other keyboard utilities installed?? (I know that DontAsk does NOT work with NOS 2.0; on the other hand, it's not needed).Steve:Thanks for your prompt reply. No, I'm not sure that Don't Ask is the culprit. I'm also running another utility called Dial A Password v1.0 from David M. Pompea. It pops up a touch-tone style keyboard when you turn the Newton on that lets you key in a password. The lock-up that I have experienced is intermittant, and I still trying to find the real culprit. Hopefully, it's not Don't Ask, and Dial A Password is running now without causing any problems, so I don't know... Thanks for your help,Jim Webb
