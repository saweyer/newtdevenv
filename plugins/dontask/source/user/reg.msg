hi xxx,Thanks for taking the time&trouble to register DontAsk.I don't have any current bugs to fix or features to add for 1.x, (I will fixit so that it won't install on 2.0) but I will keep you informed if thereare any new versions in the future.You can apply a $5 discount to NewtDevEnv or Newt's Cape if you decide toregister those later.(Although I am fairly busy with other projects, I am alwaysopen to suggestions for other apps & utilities.)
